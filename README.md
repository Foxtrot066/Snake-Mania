# Snake Game in JavaScript

This is a simple Snake Game built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game follows the classic snake game mechanics, where you control a snake to eat food, and the goal is to grow the snake without hitting walls or colliding with itself.

## Features

- **Classic Snake Mechanics:** The snake moves on the board, grows when it eats food, and resets when it hits the wall or collides with itself.
- **High Score System:** The highest score is stored in the browser's local storage and displayed on the game screen.
- **Responsive Controls:** You can control the snake using the arrow keys for up, left, down, and right, respectively.
- **Game Over Alert:** The game will reset after a collision and display a game-over alert.
